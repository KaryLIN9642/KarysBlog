                        men's fowls and dogs are lost, they know to seek for them again, but they lose their mind, and
                        do not know to seek for it. The great end of learning is nothing else but to seek for the lost
                        mind.

                <h2>Clarissa Austin</h2>
                <p>On 1/3/2023, an excellent, professional, straightforward, keep her promise, kind and
                    respected lady left us, this is definitely a sad day.<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;I still remember the scene when Clarissa was invited to come to Taiwan for the first
                    time to give a lecture and visit our company at the end of August 2008. At that time, I used my poor
                    English to ask her so many questions about Testing Standards. She explained my questions kindly and
                    told me that if I have further questions, don't hesitate to email her. After that, no matter how
                    busy she is, she will always respond to my questions. She is definitely my mentor and role model in
                    the area of geosynthetics.<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;I hope to use this way to honour the memory of Clarissa Austin.<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;May she rest in peace.<br>

                <h2>Volleyball</h2>
                <p>My first time played volleyball was on about 9 ages. But at that time, I didn't know what volleyball
                    was. I didn't join the volleyball team until I was 18 for formal volleyball training. Although I
                    don't play volleyball anymore, my favorite sport is still volleyball.<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;My volleyball coach,何慶煌(3rd from right) and teacher Subotai,<a

                    Mexico Olympics(3rd from left), they have still devoted sports activities. To me they embodied the
                    enthusiasm and sense of purpose for sport. I have the greatest respect for both of them.<br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;My favorite men's and women's volleyball team is Brazil. The best MVP and Setter in my

                <p>That was a small meet-and-greet on a beautiful afternoon in November 2000 on the NPUST campus. It was
                    also the first time I saw her very closely, an elegant, kindly lady, Dr. Jane Goodall.<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Jane Goodall, who is an English primatologist, anthropologist also renowned animal
                    conservationist and environmental advocate. She has received many honours for her environmental,
                    humanitarian and others work. In 2019, Time magazine named Goodall as one of the 100 most
                    influential people in the world.<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Dr Jane Goodall said: “Everything is connected — everyone can make a difference. If each
                    one of us reduces the consumption of water or meat in ore diet; or electricity, we are millions of
                    people reducing the consumption of resources. Let's use the gift of our lives to make this a batter
